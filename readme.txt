what to do after running:
you can chat with ELIZA and she will reply in such a way on how you talk to her. She will read keywords from your sentences.

Rules:
1)Please input simple sentences only. No compound,complex, or compound-complex sentences.
2)your sentence must be at maximum 150 characters. I think it is a reasonable length for a simple sentence.
3)avoid having the characters # and | in your sentence. since not only these are special characters I use in my program but also you almost never use it in writing.

Bugs:
creating ELIZA was pretty "buggy" becuase of the string manipulation. A bug i found is if you try to say "i can't think of anything." then it will see the "i think" keyword from the reply.txt file. In short, my program can work at its best only if the keyword is only a single word not 2 or more words such as "i think" , "i am" , etc.

special feature:
well, you can add more keywords and replies to ELIZA. Also, you can change her mood to happy ELIZA, sad ELIZA, or lunatic ELIZA, depending on the "upgrade".
